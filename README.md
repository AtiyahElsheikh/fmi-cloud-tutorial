# Using FMI on the cloud

In this tutorial we will take our FMUs to the cloud.
After a short introduction to FMPy, an FMI library for Python, we create a Jupyter Notebook and learn how to upload resources, inspect and simulate an FMU, and to plot and download the simulation results.
In the second part we write a web app and learn how to serve a web page, add input elements and finally to run a simulation on the server and to present the output.
The third part is a hackathon and Q&A where you can build your own web app and get answers to your questions and give feedback to the developers.
